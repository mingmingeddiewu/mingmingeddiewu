<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h2>
<p>I am not a geek! I'm really not! But spending time writing codes is very enjoyable!</p>
<p>I am Eddie, work as a part-time UX researcher, a part-time content strategist and also, relatively important, as a full-time leisure programmer. All my coding skills are achieved from self-learning.</p>
<p>What I have learnt:</p>
<ul> 
<li><ins>HTML</ins> <i>(A very great starter! Easy to manage and feel satisfied!)</i></li>
<li><ins>CSS</ins> <i>(Hey! you can't remember them. Just figure out what is what is excellent!)</i></li>
<li><ins>Javescript</ins> <i>(Not difficult but it contains too much variation that can hit your brain hard!)</i></li>
<li><ins>SQL</ins> <i>(Very human language and very useful for any role. We are living in data world, right?)</i></li>
<li><ins>Python</ins> <i>(Easy to learn and apply. A powerful tool for machine learning, fascinating!)</i></li>
<li><ins>Java</ins> <i>(Define and define! Again, define. OMG!)</i></li>
<li><ins>Bootstrap</ins> <i>(A combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Pay Attention! A combination, but not a simpler one!)</i></li>
</ul>
